    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Jorge Granera. I’m happy to have you here! I was born and
      raised in the San Francisco Bay Area but moved to Los Angeles to pursue a
      career in filmmaking, specifically as a screenwriter. Having said that, I
      directed a short film that sold through Creative Artist Agency (CAA). My
      most recent accomplishment was being accepted into the Universal GTDI
      Writers Lab as one of six writers selected out of 2500 candidates. This
      opportunity allowed me to spend a year learning the film business from
      studio executives and producers. While it was a fun experience and I
      gained a ton of insight, I realized it wasn’t fulfilling my need to use my
      creativity to create a direct impact on people’s lives.
    </p>

      During my time at Universal, I heard a lot of talk in the industry about
      how tech was “infiltrating” Hollywood, especially with AI. There was a lot
      of fear surrounding this new integration of film and tech, but I’ve always
      believed in facing the unknown to better understand it rather than fearing
      it. As I did my research, I became intrigued by software engineering and
      its creative potential in pioneering new spaces. I quickly realized that
      becoming a software engineer was where I wanted to channel my passion. But
      I wondered, “How would my skills as a screenwriter translate to coding?”
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the aspects that I love most about writing is my ability to problem
      solve, to look at a story and ask, “How can I make this better? How can I
      make this stronger? How can I deliver a better product to the audience?” I
      discovered that these same questions drive innovation in the tech
      industry. How can we create products that directly and immediately benefit
      people? Essentially, “How can we be of service to others?” When I started
      coding, I found a significant overlap between writing and coding. Both
      require problem-solving, strong attention to detail, and effective
      communication skills to convey and sell ideas. The key difference is that
      writing is a solitary experience, but work as a software engineer is
      highly collaborative. You’re part of a team, constantly collaborating to
      achieve a common goal. I thrive in that environment! Growing up playing
      sports and bass guitar in a punk hardcore band taught me the value of
      teamwork and collaboration, qualities I actively seek in any working
      environment.

      Anyways, that’s a bit about me. I’m sure with time I’ll refine this
      further, but for now, this is the raw version.

      Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out! I'd love to connect
      with other like-minded individuals!
