<h1>The Best Movies According to Jorge</h1>
<h2>The Top Three Movies That Always Make Me Cry</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Big Fish</h3>
<p>
  This is my all time favorite movie. It tackles a lot of topics I personally
  relate to. There is the storyteller aspect. The father/son dynamic and the
  hopeful optimism that being a good person can get you far in life. I cry when
  I get to the end and Will and his father are able to come to an understanding
  about each other. It is a perfect film.

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>
  A powerful story that honestly is better than it needed to be. Truthfully, if
  the tone would've stayed the way it was during the first two acts I think it
  would've been a classic action movie. But when it dives into the lives of the
  characters and the hurt they are experiencing it takes this film to a level
  that made it an instant classic. I cry everytime Evelyn realizes how much she
  loves Waymond and how he is her connection to seeing the good this existence
  has to offer.

<h3>Cinema Paradiso</h3>
<p>
  A simple, yet powerful story. This is a filmmaker's love letter to film and
  the places we come from. I can't quite articulate what it is about this movie
  that I find so sad. I think it might be because its about the passage of time
  and how the magic we experience as a kid changes as we get older. The memories
  are forever there but that time has passed and we can never go back and
  connect to it in the same way. This is a film that will always hold a special
  place in my heart.
